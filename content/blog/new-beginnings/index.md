As Benjamin Franklin said to Jean-Baptiste Le Roy, "The only two certainties in life are death and taxes". However, there are some countries which don't have taxes such as the UAE and Monaco. So that only leaves one certainty: death. Although some people fear death, the fact of death acts as a motivator for life. When you think of every day as one step closer to the grave, what can you do that gives meaning to life?

For many, life is about leaving a legacy - a mark to say to the rest of the world, "I existed". That's why you might see some people graffiti in the public restrooms, "Brandon was here", or people carving their initials into a tree. However, legacies don't have to be in the form of engraved names. A legacy can be in the form of a child, writing a book, or even creating an artwork.

To me, I think the best type of legacy is invention. The likes of Leonardo da Vinci and Thomas Edison will forever be etched in history. But when you think more deeply about the world, there are so many things we use that we don't know who invented it. For example, most people would not remember who invented the seat belt, or the microwave, or even just a ballpoint pen. In a way, I admire these anonymous inventors. I like to imagine that they created what they did simply to make the world a better place. In the end, their invention forever changed how people live. Now that's a powerful legacy.

Looking at life from this perspective, I see myself as one of these silent contributors to the world. Although I don't see myself becoming another da Vinci, I can imagine myself at least making a small contribution to improve the way people live. In other words, what gives meaning to my life can be summarised as follows - I want to help improve the lives of those around me.
